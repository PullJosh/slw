# Super Liam World

-100% original amazing platforming game.

## Developing

First you'll want to get everything installed:

```bash
$ yarn global add flow-bin gulp-cli    # Flow https://flowtype.org/ & Gulp
$ yarn                                 # The actual thing

# or

$ sudo npm i -g flow-bin gulp-cli      # Flow https://flowtype.org/ & Gulp
$ npm install                          # The actual thing
```

Then you'll want to start getting the app being built:

```bash
$ gulp build    # once
$ gulp watch    # for changes
```

And then you can open up index.html in your browser. (With `watch`, Whenever you make changes to the `src` folder, everything will be rebuilt.

Also please run `flow` decently frequently because it might help you with issues and stuff. (Also it would be nice if no errors came from `flow`!) (Also you should really just get a flow linter or whatever for your favorite text editor. It hopefully exists.)
