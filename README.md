-100% original amazing platforming game.

## Developing

First you'll want to get everything installed:

```bash
# Flow https://flowtype.org/
$ sudo npm install -g flow-bin
# The actual thing
$ npm install
```

Then you'll want to start getting the app being built:

```bash
$ npm watch
```

And then you can open up index.html in your browser. Whenever you make changes to the `src` folder, everything will be rebuilt.

Also please run `flow` decently frequently because it might help you with issues and stuff. (Also it would be nice if no errors came from `flow`!) (Also you should really just get a flow linter or whatever for your favorite text editor. It hopefully exists.)
