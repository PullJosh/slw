# Contributing

## New to the project?

Blah blah contribution info for new people here.

## People developing the project

Important things.

### Document code well.

This is critical to writing any good project, so let's do that, okay?

That means writing descriptive explanations about every (non-anonymous, obviously) function and how they should be used.

### Use Flow.

As far as I know, Flow works best when it's used on *every* (non-anonymous, again..) function, so please do that.

If we're going to use a tool let's use it well.

### Don't add a tool without discussing it first, okay?

Thanks.

The more tools, the worse.

Chances are, if you're thinking about adding a tool, but the project already works great without it, *it's not necessary.* If you *do* think it would really help, though, please do discuss that in the Gitter room or a GitHub issue!
