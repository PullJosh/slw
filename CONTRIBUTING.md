# Contributing

## New to the project?

Blah blah contribution info for new people here.

Instructions to install and build and whatever are in the readme file.

## People developing the project

Important things.

### Document code well.

This is critical to writing any good project, so let's do that, okay?

That means writing descriptive explanations about every (non-anonymous, obviously) function and how they should be used.

### Use Flow.

As far as I know, Flow works best when it's used on *every* (non-anonymous, again..) function, so please do that.

If we're going to use a tool let's use it well.

### Don't add a tool without discussing it first, okay?

Thanks.

The more tools, the worse.

Chances are, if you're thinking about adding a tool, but the project already works great without it, *it's not necessary.* If you *do* think it would really help, though, please do discuss that in the Gitter room or a GitHub issue!

### Code style is nice too.

(These guidelines are mostly for JS only, but if you can obviously apply one to another type of language do that okay?)

**Don't use lines that are 80 characters or longer.** Try to split them into multiple lines.

**Put spaces before your parenthesis when dealing with keywords:**

```js
// bad
if(x < y)

// good
if (x < y)
```

A keyword is not a function.
